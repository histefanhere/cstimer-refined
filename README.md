[![Install directly with Stylus](https://img.shields.io/badge/Install%20directly%20with-Stylus-238b8b.svg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/histefanhere/cstimer-refined/master/src/cstimer-refined.user.styl) [![Gitmoji](https://img.shields.io/badge/gitmoji-%20😜%20😍-FFDD67.svg)](https://gitmoji.dev)

A userstyle for [csTimer](https://cstimer.net/) that makes it look much more familiar to the modern web and only takes minutes to install. This is a fork of the abandoned [backus/cstimer-makeover](https://github.com/backus/cstimer-makeover), with many new features and bugfixes.

## Design

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> This project is under heavy development, so things aren't finished yet

There are 3 main design philosophies behind this project, in order of importance:

1. Compatibility: It should work on all browsers, on all screen sizes, on all different types of devices.
2. Community: It should be easy for others to use the style, and to contribute to it. 
3. Familiarity: You know when something just feels 'right'? It's intuitive, it's easy to pick up, and you don't get lost trying to use it.

## Installation

In order to be as compatible as possible, cstimer-refined is written as a **userstyle** which can only change the appearance of websites. You'll need to install an extension that can apply custom userstyles, and thankfully the community has some for almost every browser:

- Chrome, Opera and Edge: [Stylus](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne)
- Firefox: [Stylus](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/)
- Safari: [Cascadea](https://cascadea.app/) (untested)
- Android: Stylus with [Kiwi Browser](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kiwibrowser.browser)

Once you have the extension, simply click the button below and click the "Install Style" button on the page that opens:

📦 [Install the usercss](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/histefanhere/cstimer-refined/master/src/cstimer-refined.user.styl)

And that's it! It supports automatic updates, so you will always have the latest version.
